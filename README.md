# YelpCamp
This is a simple web application developed as part of the Udemy Course Web Development Bootcamp taught by Colt Steele. This application uses the MEN stack (Mongo, Express, NodeJS), and it allows users to sign up and upload postings of campgrounds. Each campground is complete with a picture, a nightly rating, and a short description of the campsite.

The app can be found [here](https://lgd-yelpcamp.herokuapp.com/).
